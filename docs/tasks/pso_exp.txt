Let's assume the following structure
- Experiment Set is composed of multiple experiments
- Experiment is composed of multiple Run Sets
- Run Set is composed of multiple Runs
- Run is a PSO optimize run

Let's state the following facts
- We have a custom PSO implementation in src.pso.pso.py file, let's call it custom PSO
- We have OOTB PSO (pyswarm) in src/pso/pyswarm_pso.py, let's call it pyswarm PSO

+ Create two experiments Sets
    - first experiment set to test the implementation of the custom PSO
        againest the OOTB PSO using global effect not informants. 
        Do this by setting the infomant coefficient to zero in the 
        custom PSO and select the right config in the OOTB PSO
    - second experiment will use the infomant effect instead of 
        global effect
+ Each Experiment Set will have multiple Experiments, each Experiment will have a 
    specific combination of PSO parameter values and optimization function
+ Each Experiment will have 3 Run Sets, first for Custom PSO, second for OOTB PSO
    with the given Experiment PSO parameters and the third for the OOTB PSO with
    its default paramters (pyswarm default parameters)
+ Each Run Set will run the same PSO algorithm with the same parameters on the
    same optimization function the find mean and std

+ At the end print the results in the following format
    - title show whether we are test global or infomants effect (Experiment Set)
    - table for each Experiment Set
    - Row for each parameters  
    - Column for each Run set containing its mean and std
